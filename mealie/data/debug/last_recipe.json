Rick's recipe also includes a layer of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and poblanos topped with cheese, for a substantive yet meat-free meal; you could also add chorizo, refried beans, queso fresco, and/or guacamole. Serve for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner.",

Heat a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over high until you see wisps of smoke, about 2 minutes. Arrange serrano chile, skin side down, on one side of pan and add 16 oz. cherry tomatoes. Cook, leaving chile undisturbed and occasionally tossing tomatoes, until charred, 6\u20138 minutes. It is going to get a little smoky so turn on the vent and open a window.

Increase speed to medium-low and pur\u00e9e until salsa is almost smooth but some chunks remain. Don\u2019t be tempted to blend on high or you will incorporate air into the salsa and it will look and taste more like a smoothie than a salsa.

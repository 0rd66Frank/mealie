# Getting Started
To deploy docker on your local network it is highly recommended to use docker to deploy the image straight from dockerhub. Using the docker-compose below you should be able to get a stack up and running easily by changing a few default values and deploying. 

Alternatively, this project is run in python. If you are deadset on deploying on a linux machine you can run this in an python enviromnet with a dedicated MongoDatabase. Provided that you know thats how you want to host the application, I'll assume you know how to do that.

[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

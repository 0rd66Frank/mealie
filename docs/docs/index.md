<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

**Mealie** is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend application built in Vue for a pleasant user experience for the whole family. Easily add recipes into your database by providing the url and mealie will automatically import the relevant data or add a family recipe with the UI editor.  

Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications. **Why does my recipe manager need an API?** An API allows integration into applications like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that can act as notification engines to provide custom notifications based of Meal Plan data to remind you to defrost the chicken, marinade the steak, or start the CrockPot. Additionally, you can access any available API from the backend server. To explore the API spin up your server and navigate to http://yourserver.com/docs for interactive API documentation. 

!!! note
    In some of the demo gifs the styling may be different than the finale application. demos were done during development prior to finale styling.

!!! warning
    Note that this is a **ALPHA** release and that means things may break and or change down the line. I'll do my best to make sure that any API changes are thoughtful and necessary in order not to break things. Additionally, I'll do my best to provide a migration path if the database schema ever changes. That said, one of the nice things about MongoDB is that it's flexible!
